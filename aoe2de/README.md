# WHAT is bad:

* ![Bad](select_civ_britons_bad.png)

# WHY it is bad:

* The civilization description is a wall of text with no font header size changes and a single color effectively makes the entire thing "noise".

# HOW to make it good:

Good UI has a good S:N:~N (Signal:Noise:Anti-Noise) ratio.

* Increase header sizes, and/or
* Add a splash of color to highlight the numeric values gamers _actually_ care about

For example, even highlighting the numeric values while leaving the headers size alone is an improvement:

* ![Better](select_civ_britons_better.png)

With color alone we don't even need to tweak the header sizes:

* ![Best](select_civ_britons_best.png)
